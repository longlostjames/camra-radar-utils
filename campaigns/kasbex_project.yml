      abstract: |-
        INCUS [INvestigation of Convective UpdraftS; Haddad and Sy, 2024] is a satellite mission due to be launched in May 2026 in which three
        satellites will be flown in a tight convoy, separated by 30s and 90s, with the first and third separated by 120s. Each satellite has a
        downwards-facing Ka-band meteorological radar, and the centre satellite has a radiometer with a large swath for a wider view of the cloud
        field. The fundamental idea is that, by comparing radar scans of the same location separated by short time intervals, it is possible to
        estimate convective cloud growth and mass flux– the delta-Z method. This method has been tested in a previous study [Dolan et al., 2023].
        However, they used C-band radars, and were limited to individual case studies. We plan to extend this analysis using Kepler– a Ka-band
        radar (to match INCUS) in combination with CAMRa– an S-band radar, and the proposed radar time here would allow us to characterize the
        differences between the two, as has been done previously for different frequencies than ours [e.g., Huang et al., 2019, Hunzinger et al., 2020].
        This would be of interest in its own right, but would also allow us to unlock the full potential WesCon-WOEST dataset [Barr et al., 2025], which
        has thousands of scans from both radars, allowing us to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the delta-Z method.
